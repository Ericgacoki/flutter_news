# Flutter News API

A flutter project consuming the NewsApi. I used this project to learn one two things here and there about Flutter.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
